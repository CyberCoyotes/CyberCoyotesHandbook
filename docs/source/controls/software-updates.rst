Software Updates
========================
Every season there are a series of updates for your computer and the robot software. We've compiled a list of essential updates and some commmon ones that our team uses.

---------------------
Primary
---------------------
The NI Game Tools and WPILIB Suite must be updated every year after the game release. Most other programs will update on their own when they release updates.

- [ ] Install `NI Game Tools <https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html>`_ .
    - [ ] Update the RIO Image (also needs `Balena Etcher <https://etcher.balena.io/>`_ if using RIO2 and an external SD card reader)
    - [ ] Radio (radio utility)
    - [ ] Driver's Station
- [ ] Install `WPI LIB Suite <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases>`_. It includes VS Code for doing the actual coding.

Secondary
------------------------
These are not needed by all teams, but we use them and are used by many teams.
- [ ] Install or update `REV Hardware Client <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/>`_. Needed to update REV firmware for motors (NEOs), controllers (Spark MAX), and Power Distribution Hub.
- [ ] `Tuner X <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NVV4PWDW27Z?hl=en-us&gl=US>`_. Needed to update CTRE firmware for motors (Falcon, Kraken), controllers (Talon SRX), gyro (Pigeon), and the original Power Distribution Panel. See also `CTRE <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/software/>`_ website 
- [ ] `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ client.
- [ ] `PathPlanner <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/releases>`_ for help planning swervedrive autonomous paths.

After downloading software and updating firmares, you need to import last year's code or start a new project. Part of this process will likely involve updating vendor libraries. The ones we use use have been listed below.
